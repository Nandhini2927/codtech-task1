objective:
The objective of the BasicCalculator Java program is to provide a simple command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.
about the program:
Imports: The program imports the Scanner class from java.util, which allows it to read input from the user.

Main Method: The entry point of the program, where execution begins.

User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then asks the user to choose an arithmetic operation from a list.
Operations:

The program supports four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each operation is handled in a switch statement that executes the corresponding calculation based on the user's choice.
Error Handling:

For division, the program checks if the second number is zero to prevent division by zero, providing an error message if this is the case.
It also handles invalid operation selections by displaying a relevant message.
Output: The results of the calculations are displayed in a clear format, showing the operation performed along with the input values and the result.

Resource Management: The Scanner is closed at the end of the program to free up system resources.
